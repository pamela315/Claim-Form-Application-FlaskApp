# Claim Form Application Flaskapp

Created on: Mar 2021

The "Claim Form Application Flaskapp" is a web-based application built using the Flask framework. It is designed to replace the traditional excel form fill-in experience, and streamline the process of submitting and managing claim forms.
This project also aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for handling claim forms by leveraging the power of Flask. By using Flask, the application offers a flexible and customizable platform to create, submit, enquiry, delete and track claim forms, reducing manual paperwork and improving overall efficiency.

## Key Features:

- **Form Creation:** It provides an intuitive interface to define form fields such as date, claim reason, department, service nature, and any additional information necessary for submitting claims.

- **Form Submission:** Users can complete and submit claim forms through the application. The form submission process includes uploading supporting documents, providing relevant details, and validating input data to ensure accuracy and completeness.

- **User Authentication:** The application incorporates user authentication by submission id and password to ensure that only individuals who hold the user credential can track their claim forms. This helps maintain data security.

- **Form Management:** The application provides enquiry, change and delete application functions. User who submits the application can change their application by inputting their submision id, user name and download the corresponding claim form. User can also make an enquiry by inputting the user name and the enquiry code.
